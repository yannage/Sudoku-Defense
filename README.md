# Sudoku Defense

A simple Sudoku Tower Defense proof-of-concept. This repository contains an `app` directory with all assets and HTML/JS/CSS files.

## Running the project

1. Install Node.js (v14 or later recommended).
2. From the repository root, install the project dependencies (none are required, but `http-server` will be used via `npx`).
3. Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will launch a lightweight HTTP server serving the `app` directory. By default it runs at `http://localhost:8080`.

Open your browser at the above address to play the game.
